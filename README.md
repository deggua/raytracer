TODO:
* Fix diffuse lighting model (atm it's a unit sphere at the surface normal, but I think it needs to be a half-sphere)
* Implement texture mapping for at least spheres/skybox
* Implement normal maps
* PBR/RayTracing.io stuff
* Read the sampling section of the PBR book
* Read more about how I should be generating random numbers (if it even matters, xorshiro is fast which is good)
